# Big O Analysis and Caching
## Fibonnacci with Memoization and Hash Maps

## Requirements

- Python 3 installed locally.

## Set Up

1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute the scripts using Python. Example: `python3 1_hash_maps.py`.

**NOTE:**

Used dynamic programming to speed up calculations by storing the results of previously calculated results in a cache. This significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from exponential O(2^n) to linear O(n).
